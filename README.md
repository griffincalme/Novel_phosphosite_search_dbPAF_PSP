# Novel_phosphosite_search_dbPAF_PSP
A couple of scripts intended to search against phosphosite plus and dbPAF to check if identified phosphosites have already been catalogued.

The "mod site" scripts check based on the phosphorylation site and amino acid (e.g. S114 for BRCA1).

The "homology" scripts check if the window around the phosphosite (+/- 7 amino acids) is identical to the phosphosite windows in the databases.

Proceed at your own risk, since I think my method for cross-checking doesn't work so well.
